This project presents a high-performance simulation of chlorine gas removal in a PBR using Intel's oneAPI SYCL framework and dpctl Python package. Leveraging heterogeneous computing across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, the simulation models external diffusion-limited Clâ‚‚ absorption. Key features include GPU-accelerated tensor operations on large grids (50,000 points), flexible device management via dpctl's device query system, and seamless integration with NumPy and Matplotlib for rapid prototyping and visualization. The implementation combines numerical Euler method solutions and analytical concentration profiles, validated against theoretical models, with a scalable design poised for future enhancements like fully parallelized SYCL kernel offloading.
